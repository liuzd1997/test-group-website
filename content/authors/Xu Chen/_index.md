Xu Chen pursues a research passion at the intersection of dynamic systems, information processing, and controls, to better understand and engineer smart machines that positively impact our lives. He leads the MACS Lab — a team focusing on sensing, actuation, and automation that facilitate e.g., robots that inspect complex, highly reflective parts in aerospace, and additive manufacturing that make engineered materials with extraordinary properties at low unit costs compared to conventional machining. Xu Chen also serves as Director of the Boeing Advanced Research Collaboration at UW – an interdisciplinary Boeing-UW partnership for the future of flight. He is a recipient of the U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the SME Sandra L. Bouckley Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award, the IFAC Mechatronic Systems Outstanding Young Researcher Award, and the Young Investigator Award from ISCIE/ASME International Symposium on Flexible Automation. He is an alumnus of the US NAE Frontiers of Engineering.
