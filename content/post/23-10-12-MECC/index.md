The MACS lab participated in the Modeling, Estimation, and Control Conference (MECC) held at Lake Tahoe. During the event, we hosted a workshop covering a range of topics, including part segmentation, viewpoint generation, camera control, robot controls, and the application of AI for highly precise robotic inspection (Colin Acton, Arun Nandagopal, SangYoon Back).
