      title: Outreach
      subtitle: ''
      text: Equipped with state-of-the-art hardware and software for additive manufacturing, robotics, and active vibration and noise controls, the Machine, Automation, and Control Systems (MACS) laboratory at UConn conducts systematic research on mass customization, short-run and high-value manufacturing, and controls of complex systems. Our in-house built laser-aided powder bed fusion additive manufacturing testbeds provide unique access to understand, control, and recreate the powerful manufacturing process tailored to user needs. Our Universal Robots, KUKA, and educational robot platforms provide a comprehensive suite of hardware for collaborative robotics research and applications. Our customized control algorithms augment the capabilities and intelligence of the machines and facilitate long-range autonomy applications. <div align=center>![ \label{fig:outreach1}](./Figures/outreach1.png) Below are some of our education and outreach platforms and activities. <div align=center>![ \label{fig:outreach2}](./Figures/outreach2.jpg) <div align=center>![ \label{fig:outreach2}](./Figures/outreach3.jpg) <div align=center>![ 3D Printing:Learning by Building, Design Competition, fall 2016 \label{fig:outreach4}](./Figures/outreach4.jpg)
