# Additive manufacturing
Additive manufacturing (AM), a process used to construct 3D parts layer-by-layer directly from digital models, has the potential to overcome various fundamental limitations in traditional manufacturing. Powder bed fusion (PBF), in which new material is added by applying and selectively melting a powdered feedstock, is a popular form of AM for broad applications ranging from advanced jet-engine components to custom-designed medical implants. The objective of this project is to develop an open-configuration powder bed fusion AM (PB FAM) machine as a research testbed that is as close to commercial machines as possible, yet highly flexible for research such as advanced sensing and controls to make sense of the complex physical process, and transformative approaches for sustainable and adaptive mass customization.
