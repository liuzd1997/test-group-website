A signature capability of humans and intelligent systems, adaptation has been not only a frequent scientific inquiry but also a central pillar in feedback controls. Adaptive control and system identification are central for understanding system models and high-performance control in unknown and/or time-varying control environments. While local convergence in stochastic adaptive control has been the norm and flexible adaptation to combined fast and slow time-varying dynamics is difficult with limited computation power, we achieved to show that efficient minimum-parameter adaptation can remedy such challenges. The result is a class of stability-assured adaptive controls that achieve highly robust feedback performance under unknown and/or extremely time-varying disturbances.
