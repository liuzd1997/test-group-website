Fast situational awareness and feedback control is a defining issue for converging autonomous robotic operations and the like. Autonomous onboard defense and underwater systems, for instance, must rapidly respond to potential high-speed threats in new age defense applications. While safety and performance requirements demand fast and provably safe system response to the extrinsic environment, perception sensors such as cameras and sonar are prohibitively slow for closing the autonomous control loop with environmental feedback. Failure to address this fundamental challenge obstructs the advancement of numerous autonomous mobile platforms such as underwater vehicles, self-driving cars, and human-safe collaborative robots. In pursuit of resolving this significant theoretical and application barrier, this research project targets to create new information feedback mechanisms for systematic fast controls under slow information feedback.
