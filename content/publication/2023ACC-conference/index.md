abstract: This paper presents a least squares formulation and a closed-form solution for identifying dynamical systems using non-uniform data obtained under a coprime collaborative sensing scheme. Specifically, the method combines measurements from two slow output sensors with different sampling rates to estimate the systemâ€™s dynamics. We provide the theoretical foundation for developing advanced least-squares-based system identification algorithms for cases where the input-output data are sampled at different rates. Demonstrative examples are provided to validate the proposed method, and to show the identification beyond the Nyquist frequency.
